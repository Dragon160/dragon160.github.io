Hi everyone,

I'd like you to welcome to my blog. I am a software engineer working at [Zühlke][4] in Munich, Germany.

My daily work is all about consulting and programming for my customers - mainly for topics like

1. Cloud Providers like Azure
1. .NET / C# Development
1. Mobile Development for iOS / Android (often with [Xamarin / Xamarin.Forms][5] and [MvvmCross][6])
1. Agile Consulting

Over the time I collected a lot of topics / ideas and other things in my head so I thought by myself: "It's time for an own blog" :-)

I know it is very difficult to bring a blog like this to live; and even more diffcult: keep it alive!
So, lets see how it works out..

A few things to the blog itself:

Its hosted by [Github][1] and uses the [Jekyll][2] engine as the site generator. So - all I have to do is to write down my blog posts as markdown and the engine is responsible
for generating valid html out of it. 

I also tried a lot of different themes. At the end I decided give [Jacobs][7] theme 'Carte Noire' a chance - it looks very nice and clean and I really love dark themes.

So, I hope you like it.

Michael
